UHP Year 3 Project

## Brainstorming

### Technologies being considered

#### JQuery 
* Originally game-changing, made working with JS much easier
* Modern JS makes it not as essential anymore
* Still makes some things easier like CSS animations

#### Fabric.js 
* Makes HTML Canvas easier to work with 
* Objects on Canvas are actual objects that can be manipulated easily
* Shapes come with built-in draggable, resizable, rotatable functionality
* Full potential of this library may not be used

#### React 
* Good for UI
* Popular
* May be difficult to integrate with other libraries
* If do not use other libraries, will have to implement node interactivity from scratch
* Will be harder to implement, but good learning experience if used
