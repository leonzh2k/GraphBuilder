# GraphBuilder
LIVE DEPLOYMENT LINK: https://leonzh2k.github.io/GraphBuilder/

Experimental graph algorithm visualizer built for Year 3 UHP project.  Unpolished and buggy at the moment. To get a guaranteed bug-free experience of how the visualization works, just run the algorithms on the given graph without modifying anything. I think Dijsktra's and Prim's are the most visually interesting. Designed for desktop only currently.

### Features
* Create and drag nodes, edges, and edge weights
* Visualizes BFS, Dijkstra's and Prim's

### Technologies 
* JQuery 
* SCSS

### Bugs
* Running algorithms when there exist nodes with no edges completely breaks everything
### TODO
* add visual indicator that you can't rename or delete nodes or edges during algorithms
* add ability to load in a file containing graph data
* preset graphs for the lazy
* fix command queue of DFS
* add ability to pause algorithm, go forward or backward, 
* add speed button
